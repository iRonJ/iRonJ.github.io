I created this AI roadmap last year for our internal team, and we’re somewhere around line 6.5 as of May 2024 (current video multimodal models are just looking at periodic frames so I don’t count that as true video yet) and on the lower bound of my time estimates. Every step along the way though will have a huge rush of innovation and development and experimentation of new product categories, which is very exciting, but can also sometimes create red herrings that people chase after.

It's important to keep the end goal in mind when doing product development so you don't stagnate in a local maximum.
