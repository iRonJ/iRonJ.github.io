I'm excited to share a new fan-made project: **Nate the Hoof Guy Simulator**. It's a web-based simulation game inspired by the oddly satisfying videos of bovine hoof trimming.

This game was built as a fun experiment in WebGL and procedural texture generation. It simulates the process of trimming a cow's hoof, finding defects, and treating them. It features realistic (well, stylized) hoof layers, tools like a hoof knife and spray, and even a scoring system!

Most amazingly, I built this entirely with the help of AI assistants, iterating on the physics, the rendering of the hoof layers, and the game logic. It's a testament to how quickly we can now prototype and build complex interactive 3D experiences.

Grab your hoof knife and get to work! It works great on mobile and desktop.
**Controls:**
- **Mobile:** 2 Fingers to Rotate/Cut. 1 Finger to Spray/Select.
- **Desktop:** Mouse to cut. Scroll wheel to rotate the knife angle.
