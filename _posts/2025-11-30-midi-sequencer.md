I've been working on a React-based MIDI Poly-Sequencer with auto-scroll functionality. It features a virtualized list for performance, canvas-based visualization, and MIDI file import capabilities.

Check it out below!

### Features
- **Auto-Scroll**: The sequencer automatically scrolls to follow the playback.
- **MIDI Import**: Import your own MIDI files to visualize and play them.
- **Touch Support**: Includes a touch pad for interactive play.
- **Synthesizer**: Built-in oscillator-based synthesizer.

The source code is available in the app itself (view source).
