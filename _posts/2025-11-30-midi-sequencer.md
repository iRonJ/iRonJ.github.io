Inspired by instagram videos of a user playing a "stylophone" i wanted to see if i could replicate this on an iPhone. There are many tools that could possibly be used to do this, but i decided to try out Google Gemini's mobile iOS app. It has a "Canvas" mode where the AI will generate react-based apps and other types of content, that you an view directly in your browser. The results were incredible. The AI did exactly what i asked, and even when I thought it wouldn't be able to parse a MIDI file, it did it without any issues.

I continued to use the AI to iterate the app, all while lounging on the couch, and because of the features of modern day browser, the app runs great and feels like a native app. It scratched the musical itch i was having.

Check it out below!
