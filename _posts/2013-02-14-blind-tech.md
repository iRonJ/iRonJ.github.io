One of my more successful early projects was creating a way to [allow blind users to control classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNedzQu1MA) technology. The implementation used features of Crestron panels in a clever way to allow users, both blind and sighted, to swipe through a "virtual list" that could be built from just a text configuration. The gesture approach mirrored Apple's VoiceOver screenreader, although I was completely unaware of VoiceOver at the time-- the similarity was purely coincidental.

I was invited to the CSUN conference in San Diego, which is the largest accessible technology conference in the world, to present the project, and it was well received. I also did a poster session for EduCause in Colorado, as well as a presentation at the UNC Systems Classroom Summit higher-ed conference.
