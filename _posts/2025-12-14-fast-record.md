I'm happy to introduce **FastRecord**, a new lightweight screen recording tool I've been working on. Everything runs locally on your device, with no data sent to the cloud.

This project actually started many years ago as a series of experiments with WebRTC. I recently revisited it, using AI to help clean up the code and refactor it for a proper public release, rebuilding the whole thing with React and Vite. You can check out the source code at [https://github.com/iRonJ/FastRecord](https://github.com/iRonJ/FastRecord).

FastRecord is designed to be the quickest way to capture audio directly from your browser. No installs, just click and record. It's built with modern web technologies to ensure high performance and privacy—your recordings stay local until you decide to export them.

Hint: Use your scroll wheel and pinch to zoom to adjust your camera image!

Give it a try below!
