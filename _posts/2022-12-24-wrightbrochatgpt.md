There's a lot of discussions, often derisively, that many AI apps are "just" ChatGPT wrappers. I wrote a short article that was promoted to the [front page of LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3TjfowjTcHEL56Nyp/chatgpt-is-our-wright-brothers-moment) about this, trying to convey that just because a tool is an AI wrapper doesn't mean it's not significant.
