I'm excited to share a new mini-game: **Find Your Jacket**. It's a short, atmospheric puzzle game set in a frozen cabin.

This game was actually built using my new narrative tool, [Game Storyizer](/game-storyizer/). I used the tool to map out the puzzle logic and item interactions, then exported the data to drive the game's state machine. It was a great way to test the tool in a real-world scenario!

Most amazingly, i built this all on my phone, lounging on my couch, just talking to an AI. In my 35 years of programming, writing code since i was in 4th grade, this was the most blissful programming experience i've ever had. We're truly in a new era of AI driven creativity!!

Explore the cabin, find items, and see if you can escape the cold. It works great on mobile. You can use WASD keys on desktop, and click and drag to move the camera and interact.
