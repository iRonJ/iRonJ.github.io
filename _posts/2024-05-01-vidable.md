[Vidable.ai](https://www.vidable.ai/) was a startup I worked for. It was a platform that connected to video sources, and later websites and documents, to feed an AI system. The initial release focused on a chat assistant feature, but the main R&D focus i lead was looking beyond the chat box, and into creating ai generated "artifacts". Once AI has access to a customer's specialized data, the thinking was that by the selective nature of this data, the AI could autonomously understand the market niche, and based on the content, determine on its own what sort of things to create, from documents, to applets, to push communications.
