As an aficianado of the Mars Rover missions, I decided to create a simple app that would allow me to view the latest images from the Mars Rover missions. I used SwiftUI and Xcode to create the app, and I'm quite happy with the results. The app is simple, but it does what I want it to do: show me the latest images from Mars in an easy to use UI.

Dare mighty things!
